# Who am I?

I'm a player and developer (different than KoGaMa moderator) in an online game called KoGaMa. I create music, code, and other stuff to help players and better understand the game. I also occasionally make videos of the game sometimes on my channel.

# What is the reason for your ban?

I was banned on June 11th 2025 on the discord server of KoGaMa because I was shown in a cheat tool video that I was credited in. I only know of it now because one of the KoGaMa discord server moderator told me this.

# Why do you think you should be unbanned?

First of all, I was credited in the cheat tool video because I was friends with the person who made it because I was his friend and I didn't help make the cheat nor create it. Also, I don't even have a copy of the cheat he made. Lastly, I don't even have experience in hacking on launcher.

# Did you get unbanned yet?

No I didn't. When I told one of the moderator of the discord server about it they said it's under analysis. I am still waiting for a reply.
